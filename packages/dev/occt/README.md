# Bit By Bit Developers CAD algorithms using OpenCascade Technology kernel

<img src="https://app.bitbybit.dev/assets/git-cover.png" alt="Picture showing bitbybit.dev platform">

This project contains core OCCT 3D algorithms of Bit By Bit Developers platform which are open-sourced under MIT license. This package is independent of rendering frameworks such as BabylonJS or ThreeJS. You can build your own rendering pipeline in WebGL or WebGPU. This code potentially can also be used alongside other OCCT libraries. This library can also run in NodeJS environments.

# Principles
Bit By Bit Developers company will keep these core algorithms that you can find in this repository free and opensource for its users. These algorithms are based on other open-source projects, run and are deployed on the browser, thus there is no point of closing them down from public.

# About Bit By Bit Developers platform
Bit By Bit Developers web platform allows creators to program geometry through simple visual programming language or choose monaco typescript editor with full intellisense of bitbybit API. This cloud platform can fulfil many practical, educational and artistic needs of its users. Through familiar programming interface used in tools such as Scratch and Blockly.Games we expose powerful 3D algorithms that make it easier to implement various parametric tasks. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to share their ideas and designs. We want to encourage everyone to engage in the future of this tool.

# Dependencies

This project is based on amazing library opencascade.js that you can find at https://ocjs.org/ and a powerful OpenCascade geometry kernel, check it at https://opencascade.com
