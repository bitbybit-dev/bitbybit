## BitByBit Core Library

<img src="https://app.bitbybit.dev/assets/git-cover.png" alt="Picture showing bitbybit.dev platform">

This project contains core 3D algorithms of BitByBit's platform, which are open-sourced under the MIT license. This library is now separated from the UI to ensure protection of our corporate identity and cloud services.

### Principles

BitByBit Developers will keep these core algorithms free and open-source for its users. These algorithms are based on other open-source projects, run and are deployed on the browser, thus there is no point of closing them down from the public.

### About BitByBit Developers platform

BitByBit Developers' web platform allows creators to program geometry through a simple visual programming language or choose a Monaco TypeScript editor with full intellisense of BitByBit API. This cloud platform can fulfill practical, educational, and artistic needs of its users. Through a familiar programming interface used in tools such as Scratch and Blockly.Games, we expose powerful 3D algorithms that make it easier to implement various parametric tasks. Our goal is to make it very simple for users to share their ideas and designs. We want to encourage everyone to engage in the future of this tool.

### Major Dependencies
