# Bitbybit Documentation

> Learn how to use the Bitbybit 3D creative coding platform—from visual programming to TypeScript APIs and NPM package integration. Build parametric 3D models, product configurators, and CAD applications directly in the browser.

This is the official documentation site for Bitbybit. The platform enables designers and developers to create 3D geometry using visual programming or TypeScript code, with integration for BabylonJS, Three.js, and PlayCanvas game engines.

### Understanding Scripts & Projects

Scripts are the core building blocks in Bitbybit projects. Each project can contain multiple scripts of different types:

- Scripts Overview: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/basics/scripts/intro

Learn about:
- What scripts are and how they work within projects
- The three script types (Blockly, Rete, TypeScript)
- Script visibility settings (public/private)
- Combining multiple script types in a single project
- Exporting scripts for external use

### Blockly Editor (Visual Block-Based Programming)

Blockly provides an intuitive block-based visual programming interface, ideal for beginners:

- Introduction to Blockly: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/blockly/intro

### Rete Editor (Node-Based Visual Programming)

Rete offers a node-based visual programming interface for complex workflows:

- Introduction to Rete: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/rete/intro
- Parametric Cube Tutorial: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/rete/parametric-cube
- TypeScript in Rete Editor: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/rete/typescript-editor-component

The Rete editor includes embedded TypeScript, JavaScript, and JSON editors. This allows users to:
- Write custom code within visual programming workflows
- Access algorithms not yet available as visual components
- Combine the intuitiveness of visual programming with the power of text-based scripting

### TypeScript Editor (Monaco)

For advanced users who prefer text-based programming:

- Introduction to TypeScript: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/typescript/intro
- Hello World Tutorial: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/getting-started/typescript/hello-world

The Monaco editor (based on core technologies of VS Code) provides:
- Full IntelliSense and autocompletion
- Type safety and early error detection
- Maximum flexibility and control

## Code & Algorithm Organization

Understanding how algorithms are organized across all three editors (TypeScript, Blockly, and Rete).

- Algorithm Organization Introduction: https://learn.bitbybit.dev/learn/code/intro

This section explains:
- How algorithms are organized into common categories across all editors
- Why the same core algorithms (OCCT, JSCAD, BabylonJS) are available in TypeScript, Blockly, and Rete
- Editor-specific differences (e.g., Blockly has Functions/Variables categories, Rete uses dataflow approach)
- The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in algorithm design

Key insight: The fundamental algorithms are identical regardless of editor choice—only the method of interaction differs.

   - Similar to Scratch programming
   - Best for learning programming concepts
   - Has dedicated Functions and Variables categories

2. **Rete (Node-Based Visual)**
   - Professional node-based dataflow programming
   - Over 1,300 pre-built components
   - Includes embedded TypeScript/JavaScript/JSON editors
   - Best for complex visual workflows

3. **Monaco (TypeScript)**
   - Full text-based TypeScript programming
   - Same editor as VS Code
   - Maximum flexibility and control
   - Best for experienced developers

### Geometry Kernels

Bitbybit supports multiple CAD kernels:

- **OpenCascade (OCCT)**: Industrial-grade B-rep kernel for precise CAD operations, boolean operations, fillets, chamfers, STEP export
- **JSCAD**: JavaScript-based CSG modeling for simple shapes
- **Manifold**: Fast mesh boolean operations for real-time applications

### Game Engines

Visualization and rendering:
