## Key Concepts

### Geometry Kernels

Bitbybit supports multiple CAD kernels:

- **OpenCascade (OCCT)**: Industrial-grade B-rep kernel for precise CAD operations, boolean operations, fillets, chamfers, STEP export
- **JSCAD**: JavaScript-based CSG modeling for simple shapes
- **Manifold**: Fast mesh boolean operations for real-time applications

### Game Engines

Visualization and rendering:

- **BabylonJS**: Full-featured WebGL engine with PBR, physics, audio
- **Three.js**: Lightweight, popular 3D library with vast ecosystem
- **PlayCanvas**: Professional engine with online collaborative editor

### Editors

- **Monaco (TypeScript)**: Full IntelliSense, professional coding
- **Rete**: Node-based visual programming
- **Blockly**: Block-based visual programming for beginners

### Web Workers

All geometry kernels have web worker variants (-worker packages) for non-blocking UI:
- Asynchronous operations that don't freeze the browser
- Recommended for production applications
- Same API as main thread packages
