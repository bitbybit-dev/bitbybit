### Let's Brainstorm Some Use Cases

Here are a few ideas to get you started on what you can achieve with 3D Bits. Remember, these are just guidelines – the possibilities are vast! It's also important to understand that, depending on the complexity of the use case, you might find one of our Bitbybit.dev editors (Rete, Blockly, or TypeScript) more suitable than others. It's all about using the right tool for the right job.

*   **3D Scanning Showcase:**
    No matter what you sell—whether it’s bikes, shoes, plants, flowers, toys, or cars—use your phone to scan your products (e.g., with Gaussian Splatting apps) and showcase them in full 3D to your customers. This allows buyers to inspect products from all angles and even interact with them in novel ways.
*   **Using Existing 3D Models:**
    If you already have 3D models of your products (e.g., from CAD software or artists), you can prepare industry-standard GLTF files and easily load them into your 3D product scenes.
*   **Enhanced Presentation with BabylonJS:**
    We leverage the powerful BabylonJS game engine to display your 3D models, which means you can incorporate animations and interactive elements. Imagine presenting a 3D dress on an animated, dancing avatar! Find a game designer to help you create such animated characters, and the 3D Bits app will render them beautifully.
*   **Interactive 3D Experiences & Games:**
    With the help of a 3D developer, you can even create mini-games or physics simulations involving your products. For example, if you sell toy cars, you could let buyers drive them around a virtual racetrack directly on your product page. Your creativity is the only limit!
*   **Dynamic Product Variations:**
    Do your products have multiple variations (e.g., size, color, material)? If you offer a table in five different wood finishes and three leg styles, you can create scripts that dynamically change your 3D models based on the Shopify variant selected by the customer.
*   **Complex and Parametric Designs (CAD):**
    If you sell mechanical parts, custom furniture, jewelry, or other complex structures, and want to offer true parametric customization, you can utilize the OpenCascade OCCT 3D geometry kernel algorithms within your Bitbybit.dev scripts. This allows you to create 3D models that are precisely driven by user-provided parameters or Shopify variant options.

### Technical Details: How It Works

The 3D Bits app acts as a bridge, connecting your Shopify store with the powerful Bitbybit.dev platform. It lets you add interactive 3D experiences – designed with our visual or code-based editors – directly onto your product pages.

This opens up a vast array of possibilities for creating unique and engaging 3D product presentations. You can:
*   Showcase static 3D models (e.g., GLTF files).
*   Display realistic 3D scans created with techniques like Gaussian Splatting.
*   Design fully parametric CAD models that customers can configure.
*   Program interactive simulations or even mini-games involving your 3D products to engage users on a deeper level.

**The Workflow:**
1.  **Design on Bitbybit.dev:** First, you create or refine your 3D logic/script in one of our three coding editors on Bitbybit.dev: Rete (visual nodes), Blockly (visual blocks), or Monaco for TypeScript (code).
    ![Available Bitbybit.dev editors: Rete, Blockly, and Monaco for TypeScript, suitable for different skill levels and project complexities.](https://ik.imagekit.io/bitbybit/app/assets/blog/3d-bits-app-for-shopify/3d-bits-app-integrates-with-bitbybit-dev-low-code-visual-programming-editors-small.jpeg "Available editors for your scripts")
2.  **Export to 3D Bits:** Then, you export the script specifically for use with the 3D Bits app on Shopify.
    *Below is an example of a Rete script for creating a 3D table. It uses the OpenCascade OCCT 3D geometry kernel for the table model and imports a `.splat` file for a 3D scanned palm tree. This script is then exported to the 3D Bits app.*
    ![Rete editor showing a parametric design script for a table with an imported Gaussian Splat palm tree.](https://ik.imagekit.io/bitbybit/app/assets/blog/3d-bits-app-for-shopify/rete-editor-script-that-was-later-exported-to-3d-bits-app.jpeg "Rete editor with parametric design of table")
3.  **Integrate in Shopify:**
    *   The **BITBYBIT RUNNER theme app extension** (installed with 3D Bits) provides a block that you can easily place anywhere on your Shopify product page using the theme editor. This block creates the 3D canvas element where your experience will render.
        ![Example of the BITBYBIT RUNNER theme app extension block in the Shopify theme editor.](https://ik.imagekit.io/bitbybit/app/assets/blog/3d-bits-app-for-shopify/3d-bits-app-theme-app-extension-called-bitbybit-runner-small.jpeg "BITBYBIT RUNNER theme app extension block example")
    *   You then paste your exported script into a dedicated product metafield.
    *   The 3D Bits app will automatically detect this script and execute it on the product page, bringing your 3D experience to life for your customers.

The app essentially provides a window into the 3D world, seamlessly integrated. When building 3D Bits, we aimed for deep integration with the Shopify user experience. The 3D canvas is the primary element you add to your page, and the application can listen to changes in your Shopify variant selectors or custom input fields, sending update commands to your Bitbybit.dev scripts to dynamically reconfigure the 3D model.

## Who Is 3D Bits For?

3D Bits is designed to empower a wide range of Shopify users:

### Non-technical Merchants

*   **DIY Product Experiences:** By following our step-by-step tutorials, non-technical merchants can create engaging 3D product experiences themselves. Our low-code visual editors (Rete and Blockly) simplify the process of creating the necessary logical scripts. We genuinely hope merchants will enjoy the creative process of building 3D products as much as we do!
*   **Guided Learning:** Our tutorials cover many popular real-world e-commerce scenarios. If you're unsure which tutorial to follow for your specific need, we're always ready to guide you. Don't hesitate to reach out! If your use case is different but potentially relevant to other merchants, we'd be happy to consider preparing a new tutorial.
*   **Custom Development Support:** If merchants need assistance with creating more complex 3D scripts or unique integrations, our team is here to help. We can provide quotes for custom 3D product development services.
*   **Shopify Developer Community:** Alternatively, merchants can also reach out to the wider Shopify developer community, many of whom have skills in developing BabylonJS 3D web experiences and can leverage 3D Bits.

### Technical Merchants

*   **Unlock Full Power:** For those who are more hands-on and technically inclined, we invite you to dive deep and explore the full power of our coding editors on Bitbybit.dev. You can create highly complex 3D products that adapt and change based on various inputs, Shopify variants, and intricate logical constraints.
*   **Learn Parametric Design:** We offer many tutorials on parametric design and computational geometry at Bitbybit.dev. We believe that learning 3D design is fun and can be incredibly rewarding.

### Developers

*   **A Powerful Platform:** If you are a developer, you're in the right place! We invite you to explore the extensive possibilities of the Bitbybit.dev platform as a foundation for your 3D e-commerce solutions.
*   **BabylonJS Experts:** If you already know BabylonJS, you will feel right at home. Bitbybit.dev integrates BabylonJS with additional CAD algorithms (OCCT, JSCAD), making it easier to code complex geometry. You can even integrate native BabylonJS TypeScript code, exported from Bitbybit.dev, via the 3D Bits app. This is a great opportunity to monetize your skills by helping merchants create unique 3D products.
*   **Shopify App Developers:** If you develop apps or themes for Shopify merchants, we hope that 3D product configurators will become a valuable part of your service portfolio. The 3D Bits app can significantly help your team integrate complex 3D experiences into customer webshops efficiently.

### Comprehensive Support and Learning

We offer a wealth of tutorials and documentation that teach you everything from computational design principles on Bitbybit.dev to setting up and optimizing your 3D products with the 3D Bits Shopify app.
