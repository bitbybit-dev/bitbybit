Our **Bitbybit Runners** allow you to easily include Bitbybit.dev's powerful 3D CAD and computational geometry capabilities into your own websites via a single UMD JavaScript file. In our latest release, we're excited to introduce a completely new runner specifically for the **ThreeJS** game engine!

<!--truncate-->

Furthermore, we've developed new **Lite versions** of the runners for both ThreeJS and BabylonJS. These Lite versions allow you to load the respective game engines separately if you're already including them in your project, significantly reducing bundle sizes. Learn more about these exciting updates in this blog post.

### Brief History of the Runner

The Bitbybit Runner is a single JavaScript file you can include in your website. It bundles all the open-source components of the Bitbybit.dev platform, such as our CAD kernels (OCCT, JSCAD) and various 3D algorithms. These tools are designed to simplify the development of parametric 3D experiences, model configurators, and other geometry-intensive web applications.

About six months ago, we introduced the first version of the `bitbybit-runner`, which was fully based on the BabylonJS game engine. This version remains incredibly powerful and popular. The runner can execute Bitbybit.dev algorithms directly through JavaScript. Additionally, we added a feature that allows users to export scripts created in our visual editors (Rete, Blockly) and run them seamlessly on any browser-based coding environment (like StackBlitz, CodePen, or JSFiddle) as well as on their own websites.

### New and Improved Runners: Enter ThreeJS!

Recently, we [announced official support for the ThreeJS game engine](/blog/threejs-support) via new NPM packages. Shortly after, we received requests from the community for a dedicated runner specifically for ThreeJS. Based on your valuable feedback, we are thrilled to announce the release of a **new Bitbybit Runner for ThreeJS**!

This new runner follows the same core principles as the BabylonJS version but is specifically designed and optimized to work with ThreeJS. Like the original, it’s a single JavaScript file you can add to your website. The runner automatically loads all necessary resources, including web workers, CAD kernels, and other dependencies required to run your Bitbybit.dev scripts within a ThreeJS environment.

While developing the ThreeJS runner, we also realized that many projects already include ThreeJS (or BabylonJS) as a dependency in their existing build setups. To avoid the redundancy of loading the entire game engine again from the runner’s bundled JavaScript file, we addressed this with a new, more flexible solution.

### Introducing "Lite" Versions of the Runners

We’ve created **Lite versions** of our runners for both ThreeJS and BabylonJS. These versions allow you to load the respective game engines *separately* if they are already part of your project, thus reducing redundancy and improving load times.

The Lite bundles are significantly smaller because they **do not include the game engine dependencies** themselves. Instead, they expect the game engine (ThreeJS or BabylonJS) to be available in the global scope (e.g., on the `window` object).

If your project already loads ThreeJS or BabylonJS via a script tag, NPM import, or another method, using the Lite version of the corresponding Bitbybit Runner will prevent duplicate loading of the engine, making your website faster and more efficient.

### ThreeJS Runners: Examples in Action

![Lite ThreeJS runner in action: A 3D model configurator allows users to create a 3D printable ThreeJS logo with custom triangle definitions, ready for a Christmas tree!](https://app.bitbybit.dev/assets/blog/updated-bitbybit-runners/threejs-logo-3d-print-bitbybit-dev-runner.jpeg "Lite ThreeJS runner in action - configurable 3D printable ThreeJS logo")

The project accessible through the links below introduces the core functionality of the ThreeJS runner. It's a 3D model configurator designed to create a customizable ThreeJS logo with user-defined triangular configurations, perfectly suited for 3D printing. You could even print it to decorate your Christmas tree!

We offer the code on various third-party coding platforms, all of which support the execution of Bitbybit.dev code via the runner:

### Overview of All Available Runners

Here's a summary of the Bitbybit Runners now available:

*   **`bitbybit-runner-babylonjs.js`**
    *   This is our most powerful and feature-rich runner. It includes all necessary resources to run Bitbybit.dev scripts *and* the BabylonJS engine itself.
    *   If you don’t already have BabylonJS in your project, this is the recommended runner for BabylonJS-based experiences.
    *   It has the best support for scripts exported from our visual programming editors (Rete, Blockly) as these editors are natively built with BabylonJS.
    *   Among countless 3D algorithms, it's also capable of running Havok physics and other BabylonJS-specific features like GUI elements and advanced materials.
*   **`bitbybit-runner-lite-babylonjs.js`**
    *   A smaller, lightweight version of the BabylonJS runner that **does not include** the BabylonJS engine.
    *   It expects the `window` object to contain these global BabylonJS dependencies before initialization: `BABYLON`, `GUI`, `LOADERS`, `MATERIALS`, `SERIALIZERS`. Only then can this Lite runner initialize successfully.
    *   Use this if BabylonJS is already loaded in your project.
*   **`bitbybit-runner-threejs.js`**
    *   This runner is capable of executing all open-source Bitbybit.dev CAD algorithms within a ThreeJS environment. It bundles the ThreeJS game engine and OrbitControls in a single file.
    *   It can also execute visual scripts exported from our editors, as long as they do not contain any BabylonJS-specific logic.
*   **`bitbybit-runner-lite-threejs.js`**
    *   A lightweight version of the ThreeJS runner that **does not include** the ThreeJS engine.
    *   It expects the `window` object to contain these global ThreeJS dependencies before initialization: `THREE` (for ThreeJS itself) and `OrbitControls` (if you plan to use them via the runner's setup). Only then can this Lite runner initialize successfully.
    *   Use this if ThreeJS is already loaded in your project.

### How BabylonJS Runners Differ from ThreeJS Runners

Both sets of runners (BabylonJS and ThreeJS) can execute all of our open-source 3D modeling algorithms and interact with our CAD kernels (OCCT, JSCAD). The primary differences are related to the game engines themselves and their specific features:

*   **Visual Script Compatibility:** If you are looking to export and run scripts created with our visual programming editors (Rete, Blockly) on the Bitbybit.dev website, you will generally have more success and feature parity with the **BabylonJS runner**. Our visual editors are natively based on BabylonJS. Thus, if your scripts use specific BabylonJS features (like our built-in skyboxes, GUI elements, Havok physics integrations, specific BabylonJS materials, etc.), you should use a BabylonJS runner.
*   **Error Handling for Visual Scripts in ThreeJS Runner:** The ThreeJS runner will also attempt to run visual scripts exported from Bitbybit.dev. However, if it encounters BabylonJS-specific logic, it will throw an error as those features are not available in a ThreeJS context. That said, if you limit your visual coding to *only* contain 3D modeling-related features (CAD operations, basic geometry, etc.) without engine-specific rendering features, then your scripts *should* execute just fine with the ThreeJS runner.
*   **Direct JavaScript Coding:** If you are simply writing Bitbybit.dev logic directly in JavaScript (not exporting from visual editors), then either of these runners (BabylonJS or ThreeJS, full or Lite) will work well for you for the core CAD functionalities.
*   **Bundle Size:** You will notice that the bundle size of the full BabylonJS runner is larger than the full ThreeJS runner. This is something to consider when deciding which runner to use, especially if bundle size is a critical factor for your project. The Lite versions, of course, are much smaller for both.

No matter your preference, we love both of these incredible game engines, and we are excited to see what you will create with them using Bitbybit.dev!

### Where to Find the Runners

We are serving the Bitbybit Runners from the **JSDelivr CDN**. You can include them in your website with the following script tags. Remember to replace `<version-number-of-bitbybit>` with the actual version you intend to use.

*   **`bitbybit-runner-babylonjs.js`** (Full BabylonJS runner)
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit-assets@<version-number-of-bitbybit>/runner/bitbybit-runner-babylonjs.js"></script>
    ```
*   **`bitbybit-runner-lite-babylonjs.js`** (Lite BabylonJS runner - BabylonJS must be loaded separately)
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit-assets@<version-number-of-bitbybit>/runner/bitbybit-runner-lite-babylonjs.js"></script>
    ```
*   **`bitbybit-runner-threejs.js`** (Full ThreeJS runner)
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit-assets@<version-number-of-bitbybit>/runner/bitbybit-runner-threejs.js"></script>
    ```
*   **`bitbybit-runner-lite-threejs.js`** (Lite ThreeJS runner - ThreeJS must be loaded separately)
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit-assets@<version-number-of-bitbybit>/runner/bitbybit-runner-lite-threejs.js"></script>
    ```

**Note:** You should replace `<version-number-of-bitbybit>` with an actual version number (e.g., `0.20.9`). You can find all the official versions of Bitbybit.dev here:

### Examples of the Runners

It can be hard to guess how runners can be used in practice, which is why we provide you with actual, working examples. We create projects that fit within a single `index.html` file, which you can simply open in your browser directly from your file system. This approach doesn't even require you to run a local server on your computer. That’s the true power of the web!

➡️ **[Explore Example Use Cases of BabylonJS & ThreeJS Runners on GitHub](https://github.com/bitbybit-dev/app-examples/tree/main/runner)**

This GitHub repository contains examples that use both the full and Lite runners. We also provide examples on how to initialize BabylonJS or ThreeJS scene objects *outside* the context of the runner. This approach allows Bitbybit Runners to work more harmoniously with third-party tools or existing projects that already manage their own game engine instances (e.g., integrating with A-Frame or a custom ThreeJS setup).

Initiating scene objects *inside* the runner (letting the runner create the default scene) is also possible and is often simpler, though it offers less fine-grained control if you have a complex existing setup.

We hope these updated runners provide even more flexibility and power for your 3D web projects!
