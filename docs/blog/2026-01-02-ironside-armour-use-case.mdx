How do you sell a modular gym rack with over 60+ customizable parts online? Static images don't cut it. Videos can only show so much. And asking customers to imagine how different components fit together? That's a recipe for confusion and abandoned carts.

[Ironside Armour](https://ironsidearmour.com), a global fitness equipment company, faced exactly this challenge. Through close collaboration with our team, they developed interactive 3D configurators powered by 3D Bits - a rewarding journey that transformed how their customers shop.

## The Challenge: Selling Complex Modular Products Online

Ironside Armour designs and sells premium gym racks that customers can customize to their exact needs. We're talking about products with **60+ individual parts** that can be combined in countless configurations. Try explaining that with a product gallery.

When customers shop for modular gym equipment, they need to:
- Visualize exactly what they're buying
- Understand how parts connect and interact
- Feel confident their configuration will work
- Know the total price before checkout

Traditional e-commerce approaches simply couldn't deliver this experience. That's where 3D configurators became the obvious solution.

Today, Ironside Armour offers three fully interactive 3D configurators on their Shopify store:

- [Pro Power Rack](https://ironsidearmour.com/en/products/pro-power-rack)
- [Pro Half Rack](https://ironsidearmour.com/en/products/pro-half-rack)
- [Pro Foldable Rack](https://ironsidearmour.com/en/products/pro-foldable-rack)

Each configurator lets customers build their perfect rack, see it from every angle, and add it to cart with accurate pricing - all in real time.

## Why 3D Bits Was the Right Choice

### A Collaborative Approach to Complex Configurators

These aren't simple "pick a color" configurators. Each gym rack includes **60+ parts** with various attachment points, accessories, and configuration options. Building something this sophisticated required close collaboration between Ironside Armour and our team.

Using our visual [**Viewer Editor**](/learn/getting-started/viewer-editor/intro), we worked together to define parts, set up the configuration logic, and connect everything to their Shopify products. The Viewer Editor provides a powerful interface for building sophisticated product configurators without writing code - but that doesn't mean the process is trivial. Complex products require thoughtful planning, proper 3D model preparation, and attention to detail.

### Seamless Third-Party Integration

One of 3D Bits' core strengths is flexibility. Rather than forcing merchants into a rigid ecosystem, we built the app to integrate with the tools you already use.

Ironside Armour chose to pair 3D Bits with [YMQ Options](https://apps.shopify.com/ymq-options), a popular product options app they were already familiar with. This combination gave them:
- Complex pricing logic for modular products
- Custom option handling beyond Shopify's variant limits
- A familiar workflow for managing product options

This modular approach - where you combine specialized apps like puzzle pieces - is quite unique in the industry. Want to use a different pricing app? Go ahead. Need to code a custom solution? We support that too. 3D Bits focuses on what it does best (high-performance 3D rendering) while integrating seamlessly with your existing stack.

## From CAD to Web: Optimizing 3D Models

Like many manufacturers, Ironside Armour's 3D models originated as STEP files - the industry standard for professional CAD. But CAD models aren't built for web performance. They're built for engineering precision.

We worked closely with Ironside Armour to transform their production models into web-optimized GLTF files. This process involved:

- **Mesh optimization** - Reducing polygon counts while maintaining visual quality
- **Texture compression** - Balancing file size with crisp, realistic materials
- **Instanced loading** - A key 3D Bits feature where duplicate parts load only once and render in multiple positions at the GPU level, dramatically improving performance

We provided hands-on support and consulting during the initial setup. Ironside Armour also generously allowed us to use their actual production models in our tutorials, helping other merchants learn the optimization process.

## Long-Term Success: Growing Capabilities

Our collaboration with Ironside Armour didn't end after the initial setup - it evolved. We provided extensive support during the learning curve, and over time, they developed the expertise to manage and extend their configurators independently.

Since our initial work together, Ironside Armour has:
- Switched Shopify themes (3D Bits kept working seamlessly)
- Made multiple updates to their option app configuration
- Added new configurable parts to their configurators

Today, they confidently optimize their own 3D models, extend their configurators with new components, and maintain complex product catalogs. **This is the outcome we aim for with every client: building your capabilities through partnership, so you can grow with confidence.**
