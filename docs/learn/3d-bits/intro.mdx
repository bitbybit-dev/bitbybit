## How Does 3D Bits Work?

3D Bits is powered by the [bitbybit.dev](https://bitbybit.dev) platform, offering robust 3D and CAD tools for all skill levels:

*   **No-Code:** Quickly set up interactive 3D product pages.
*   **Low-Code:** Use visual programming for more detailed control.
*   **TypeScript:** Write custom code for advanced functionalities.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Integrate with popular 3D engines and professional tools like VSCode.

## Important Considerations

3D Bits is a powerful yet sophisticated application. Let's be honest: creating professional 3D product configurators requires time, expertise, and attention to detail. If you're seeking a plug-and-play solution that works in minutes, this may not be the right fit. Building effective 3D experiences demands knowledge of both 3D workflows and e-commerce best practices to ensure performance, security, and user experience excellence.

**However, you don't have to do it alone.** Whether you're just starting out or need specialized expertise, we're here to support you with comprehensive documentation, expert consultation, and professional development services tailored to your needs.
