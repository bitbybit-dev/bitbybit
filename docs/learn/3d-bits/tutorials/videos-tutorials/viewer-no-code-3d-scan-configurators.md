# No-Code Gaussian Splat Configurators with BITBYBIT VIEWER Editor on Shopify

## What's Inside This Tutorial?

Building on the principles of our no-code configurator, this tutorial specifically demonstrates how to create interactive 3D product experiences using **3D scanned Gaussian Splatting (.splat) assets**. We'll leverage the **Viewer Editor tool** (part of the "3D Bits" Shopify app) to set up a scene with multiple `.splat` files representing different plant variations and link their display to your native Shopify product variants.

You will learn how to:
*   Utilize the **BITBYBIT VIEWER** theme app extension block for displaying Gaussian Splat assets.
*   Employ the **Viewer Editor** to assemble and configure a 3D scene using your 3D scanned `.splat` files (e.g., different types or arrangements of plants).
*   Create a dynamic **3D plant configurator** that responds to Shopify variant selections, allowing customers to switch between different scanned plant models, all **without writing a single line of code.**

This approach is perfect for showcasing products captured through 3D scanning, especially when you want to offer variations or customizable arrangements. The realism of Gaussian Splats combined with the interactivity of a no-code configurator can significantly enhance the online shopping experience.
