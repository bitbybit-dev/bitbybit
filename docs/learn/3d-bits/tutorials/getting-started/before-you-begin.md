# Before You Begin

Let's be honest: creating professional 3D product configurators isn't a quick task. If you're looking for a plug-and-play solution that works in 5 minutes, this might not be the right fit for you.

## What to Expect

Building successful 3D experiences requires a genuine commitment to learning. You'll need to understand:
- How Shopify themes, metafields and theme app extensions work
- Basic and not so basic concepts of 3D on the web
- Understand technical aspects of 3rd party apps meant for UI customization and pricing
- Performance optimization for 3D assets
- How to structure product variants

The more complex your configurator, the more you'll need to learn. **But here's the good news**: the effort is absolutely worth it. 3D configurators can dramatically increase engagement when done right.

## Is This For You?

**You'll thrive with 3D Bits if you:**
- Enjoy learning new technologies
- Are willing to invest time in understanding the fundamentals
- Want to create truly differentiated product experiences
- Care about delivering quality to your customers

**You might want help if you:**
- Need fast results without learning the system
- Prefer someone else handles the technical implementation
- Want guaranteed expert-level results from day one

## Getting Help

If you'd rather have experts handle the setup, we offer integration services and premium support. Contact us via [info@bitybit.dev](mailto:info@bitbybit.dev) to discuss your needs, and consider our [Pro plan](/learn/3d-bits/plans/subscription-plans) which includes higher level support.

## Performance Matters

A quick note: while you can upload a 3D model to your product page quickly, **performance is your responsibility**. A 70MB file will likely hurt your sales rather than help. We'll guide you on best practices, but you're responsible for creating optimized assets that deliver fast, smooth experiences for your customers.
