# Third-Party Apps for 3D Bits

## When Do You Need These Apps?

The default Shopify variant system works well for simple product configurations. However, when you need to build **complex product configurators** that go beyond Shopify's built-in capabilities, you may need to integrate third-party product options apps with 3D Bits.

These apps are only necessary when:
- Your product has extensive customization options
- The default Shopify variant system cannot address your configuration needs
- You require advanced conditional logic or dynamic pricing
- You need more sophisticated option management
- You do not have access to professional developers who could program these product option forms

## Evaluation Checklist

:::tip Take Advantage of Trial Periods
Most of these apps offer 7-14 day free trials. **We strongly recommend using these trial periods in combination with the 3D Bits trial period** to test different solutions and find the best fit for your specific needs. Dedicate time to research and experiment with multiple options before committing to a solution. Your team should allocate sufficient time to properly evaluate how each app integrates with 3D Bits and meets your business requirements.
:::

When evaluating these apps for your 3D Bits integration, consider:

1. **Feature Set**: Does the app provide the customization options you need?
3. **Pricing Structure**: Does the pricing model fit your business?
4. **Support Quality**: Review the app's support options and response times
5. **Update Frequency**: Check how actively the app is maintained
6. **User Reviews**: Read recent reviews for insights on stability and support
7. **Trial Period**: Test the app thoroughly during the trial before committing to a paid plan

## Integration Process

Ensure you understand how 3D Bits app works and integrates with HTML form inputs:   
[**Under the hood**](./under-the-hood.md)

To integrate a product options app with 3D Bits:

1. Install and configure your chosen app
2. Set up your product options within the app
3. Enable 3D Bits theme app extension blocks on that same product page
4. [**Enable Debug mode**](./common-settings#enable-debug-mode) to see if technical input names and their current values are collected and update correctly when you change variants.
3. Test how the app exposes option data
4. Configure 3D Bits to read and respond to the selected options
5. Thoroughly test all combinations and edge cases
6. Monitor the integration after going live
