# AI Prompt Context Files

Modern AI assistants like Claude, Gemini, Grok, or ChatGPT are remarkably capable at writing code. However, they can struggle with specialized libraries and APIs they weren't extensively trained on. That's where **AI Prompt Contexts** come in - specially crafted documentation files that give your AI assistant deep knowledge of the Bitbybit API.

---

## What Are AI Prompt Contexts?

An AI Prompt Context is a markdown file designed to be attached to conversations with AI coding assistants. When you provide this context file, the AI gains comprehensive knowledge about:

- **Bitbybit's complete API** with all available functions and their parameters
- **Coding patterns and best practices** for 3D/CAD development
- **Integration approaches** for different rendering engines
- **Code examples** demonstrating correct usage patterns
- **Decision trees** that help the AI recommend the right approach based on your experience level

Think of it as giving your AI assistant a complete reference manual it can consult while helping you write code.

---

## Choosing the Right Context

We offer several context variants tailored to different needs and 3D rendering engines.

### Engine-Specific Contexts

Each context file is tailored to a specific 3D rendering engine:

| Engine | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **BabylonJS** | Full-featured 3D engine with powerful rendering capabilities |
| **ThreeJS** | Popular, lightweight 3D library for web applications |
| **PlayCanvas** | Game engine with visual editor and runtime |

The engine-specific details matter because initialization patterns, scene management, and rendering APIs differ between engines.

### Full vs Lite Versions

For each engine, we provide two versions:

#### Full Contexts

Full contexts contain everything an AI needs to help you from scratch:

- Extensive explanations of what Bitbybit is
- Project setup guides
- Integration guides for NPM packages and browser-based runners
- Best practices for performance
- Scene setup recommendations
- Complete API reference with detailed descriptions

**Best for:** Beginners or developers who want comprehensive guidance.

#### Lite Contexts

Lite contexts strip away explanations and focus purely on API definitions. They use a compressed notation to minimize token usage.

**Best for:** Experienced developers who want to set up their own custom coding rules, project preferences, or coding style guides alongside the API definitions.

### Monaco Editor Context (Beginner-Friendly)

We provide a special context for users of our online Monaco TypeScript editor at [bitbybit.dev/app](https://bitbybit.dev/app?editor=typescript). This context:

- Focuses only on what you need when coding in the browser-based editor
- Explains pre-initialized global variables available in that environment
- Covers specific patterns required for that context

**Perfect for:** Getting started with Bitbybit and experimenting in the online editor.

## Understanding the Lite Context Format

Lite contexts use an important technique to reduce file size: **a translation dictionary**.

At the beginning of the API section, you'll find a dictionary that maps abbreviated terms to their full names:

| Abbreviation | Full Name |
|--------------|-----------|
| `OC` | `OCCT` |
| `sp` | `shape` |
| `sd` | `solid` |
| `cr` | `create` |

### Critical: AI Must Translate Abbreviations

The AI must translate these abbreviations back to full names when generating code. When the AI sees something like:

```
bitbybit.oc.sh.sd.crBox(op: BoxD)
```

It should generate:

```typescript
bitbybit.occt.shapes.solid.createBox(boxOptions: BoxDto)
```

The abbreviated forms are only for documentation - they would not compile if used directly in code. The AI handles this translation transparently, so you receive clean, readable code.

:::warning
If your AI agent cannot translate these abbreviated values, the code will not work. If that happens, consider using the Full context version or a more capable AI model.

## How to Use Prompt Context Files

### Step 1: Download the Context File

Download the appropriate markdown file from the links below or from our homepage at [bitbybit.dev](https://bitbybit.dev).

### Step 2: Attach to Your AI Conversation

Most modern AI interfaces support file attachments:
- Drag and drop the file into the chat
- Use the attachment button
- Or paste the content directly

### Step 3: Start Coding with AI

Once attached, ask questions like:

- *"Create a parametric table with adjustable legs"*
- *"Show me how to create a filleted box and export it as STEP"*
- *"Build a gear with 24 teeth and a 5mm module"*

The AI will reference the context to generate accurate, working code that follows Bitbybit's recommended patterns.

## Combining with Context7 MCP

For the best experience, we recommend combining a **Lite context** with our **[Context7 MCP Server](./mcp/context-7.md)**:

- **Context7 MCP** provides live access to full documentation and stays current with the latest changes
- **Lite context** ensures the AI knows precise API signatures

Together, they create a powerful coding assistant that understands both the big picture and the fine details.

## Tips for Effective AI-Assisted Coding

### Be Specific About Your Goals

Instead of asking for "a shape," describe what you actually need:

> *"Create a rounded rectangular table top with four cylindrical legs, where the leg height and table dimensions are parametric."*

### Mention Your Experience Level

The contexts include decision trees that help the AI adapt:

- **Beginners:** The AI can scaffold complete applications
- **Experienced developers:** The AI can focus on just the API calls you need

### Iterate and Refine

AI assistants are collaborative tools. If the first attempt isn't quite right:

1. Explain what you'd like changed
2. Ask for specific modifications
3. The AI can refine suggestions while staying consistent with the Bitbybit API

---

## Staying Up to Date

The context files are updated with each Bitbybit release to match the latest API. When you see a new version available, download the updated context to ensure your AI has the most current information.

Check the version number in your context file and compare it with the latest version on [bitbybit.dev GitHub](https://github.com/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit/releases) to ensure you're using the most recent documentation.
