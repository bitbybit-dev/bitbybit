In this short tutorial, we'll create a 3D cube using the powerful OpenCascade Technology (OCCT) kernel, which is integrated into Bitbybit. The cool part? We'll control its size using a variable in TypeScript. This simple example demonstrates how you can use code to create dynamic, parametric relationships with 3D geometry.

## What You'll Learn

*   How to use the Bitbybit TypeScript editor.
*   How to define and use variables to control geometry.
*   The basics of creating a solid shape (a cube) using OCCT functions.
*   How to draw your 3D shapes onto the screen.

## 1. Start The Application

First, let's open the Bitbybit online application.

:::tip Open the Editor
Navigate to: [https://bitbybit.dev/app?editor=typescript](https://bitbybit.dev/app?editor=typescript)
:::

This will open a new, empty TypeScript workspace. For this tutorial, you can also directly use the embedded editor example provided below.

## 2. Understanding the Script

The script shown in the editor below is fairly straightforward, but let's break it down step-by-step. Feel free to click the **Run** button (usually a play icon ‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in the embedded editor to see the result before we dive deeper.


<BitByBitRenderCanvas
  requireManualStart={true}
  script={{"script":"const start = async () => {\n    const size = 10;\n    const cubeOptions = new Bit.Inputs.OCCT.CubeDto();\n    cubeOptions.size = size;\n    const cube = await bitbybit.occt.shapes.solid.createCube(cubeOptions);\n\n    bitbybit.draw.drawAnyAsync({\n        entity: cube\n    });\n}\n\nstart();\n","version":"0.20.9","type":"typescript"}}

Let's go through the code:

1.  **The `async start` Function:**
    ```typescript
    const start = async () => {
        // ... code inside the function ...
    };
    start(); // Call the function to execute it
    ```
    The script begins by defining an `async` function called `start`. This is a common pattern in Bitbybit scripts.
    *   **`async`**: This keyword allows us to use the `await` keyword inside the function. `await` is used for operations that might take some time to complete (like drawing complex 3D objects) without freezing the rest of the application.
    *   **`const start = () => { ... };`**: This defines an arrow function and assigns it to a constant named `start`.
    *   **`start();`**: After defining the function, we immediately call it to execute the code within its body.

2.  **Defining the Cube's Size:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside the start function:
    const size = 10; // Try changing this value!
    ```
    Inside the `start` function, we declare a constant named `size` and set its value to `10`. This variable will control the dimensions of our cube. This is where the "parametric" aspect comes in ‚Äì you can change this one value to change the cube.

3.  **Setting Cube Options:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside the start function:
    const cubeOptions = new Bit.Inputs.OCCT.CubeDto();
    cubeOptions.size = size;
    ```
    Here, we prepare the options for creating our cube:
    *   We create a new instance of `Bit.Inputs.OCCT.CubeDto()`. This object holds various settings for creating OCCT solid shapes.
    *   We then set the `size` property of `cubeOptions` to the value of our `size` variable.

4.  **Creating the Cube:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside the start function:
    const cube = await bitbybit.occt.shapes.solid.createCube(cubeOptions);
    ```
    This line actually creates the 3D cube geometry:
    *   We call the `bitbybit.occt.shapes.solid.createCube()` function.
    *   We pass our `cubeOptions` object to it, so it knows what size the cube should be.
    *   The `await` keyword is used because creating 3D geometry can be an asynchronous operation. The result (the cube geometry) is stored in the `cube` constant.

5.  **Drawing the Cube:**
    ```typescript
    // Inside the start function:
    await bitbybit.draw.drawAnyAsync({ entity: cube });
    ```
    Finally, we make the cube visible on the screen:
    *   We call `bitbybit.draw.drawAnyAsync()`. This is a versatile function in Bitbybit that can draw various types of entities.
    *   We pass an object with an `entity` property (our `cube`).
    *   Again, `await` is used as drawing is an asynchronous process. This will render a BabylonJS Mesh (the visual representation) of our cube in the 3D view.

That's it! When you run the script:
1.  The `size` is defined.
2.  The cube options are configured with this `size`.
3.  The OCCT kernel generates the cube geometry.
4.  The geometry is drawn to the 3D canvas.

After running the script, click the **Swap Canvas** button (usually marked with two arrows üîÅ) in the editor to switch to the 3D scene and inspect your cube. Try rotating and zooming to see it from different angles.

## Experiment!

:::tip Try It Yourself
Go back to the script in the embedded editor (or your own Bitbybit workspace).
Change the value of the `size` constant:
```typescript
const size = 3; // Or any other number
:::
Then, click Run again. You'll see the cube instantly update to its new size! This is the power of parametric modeling.

Congratulations!
You've successfully created a parametric cube using TypeScript and the OpenCascade Technology kernel within Bitbybit. You've learned how to define variables, use them to control geometric properties, and visualize the results.
This foundational knowledge can be expanded to create much more complex parametric designs!
