# Getting Started with ThreeJS

ThreeJS is a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser. It provides a simpler API on top of WebGL and has a huge community with countless examples and resources.

**Official homepage:** <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threejs.org</a>

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
Our visual programming editors (Rete, Blockly, Monaco) use BabylonJS as their rendering engine. For ThreeJS, you'll work with NPM packages or Runners directly.

## Two Ways to Use ThreeJS with Bitbybit

### 1. NPM Packages (Recommended)

If you're building a production application or prefer working with TypeScript, use our NPM packages.

The quickest way to start a new project:

```bash
npx @bitbybit-dev/create-app my-project --engine threejs
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

This creates a ready-to-run project with Vite, TypeScript, and all three CAD kernels (OCCT, JSCAD, Manifold) pre-configured.

NPM packages give you full TypeScript support with intellisense, optimized bundle sizes through tree-shaking, and are the recommended approach for production applications.

Note that NPM packages only include our open-source algorithms. To understand which parts of Bitbybit are open-source and which are not, see our [Open Source Approach](/learn/open-source-approach) guide.

### 2. Runners (Quick Prototypes)

Runners are single JavaScript files that bundle everything you need. They're perfect when you want to quickly prototype something without setting up a build environment.

**Full Runner** - Includes both ThreeJS and Bitbybit in one file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit-assets@latest/runner/bitbybit-runner-threejs.js"></script>
```

**Lite Runner** - Just Bitbybit, you load ThreeJS separately (smaller download):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@latest/build/three.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bitbybit-dev/bitbybit-assets@latest/runner/bitbybit-runner-threejs-lite.js"></script>
```

Runners work great for demos on CodePen, JSFiddle, or StackBlitz. However, they only support JavaScript (no TypeScript) and have larger bundle sizes, so NPM packages are better for production work.

## NPM vs Runners - Which Should I Use?

**Choose NPM packages** when you're building something for production, want TypeScript support, or need optimized bundle sizes.

**Choose Runners** when you're prototyping, creating quick demos, or just want to experiment without any setup.

## What About Visual Editors?

Our visual editors use BabylonJS for rendering, but the CAD algorithms are engine-agnostic. This means you can prototype ideas in our visual editors, export the script, and adapt it for ThreeJS. The Bitbybit API is largely the same across engines - the main differences are in initialization and drawing functions.

## Next Steps

If you're ready to build, run the NPX command above and check out the [starter template guide](/learn/npm-packages/threejs/start-with-three-js).

If you want to understand ThreeJS better, read [About ThreeJS](/learn/npm-packages/threejs/about-threejs) for a deeper look at the library's capabilities.
